<p align="left">✨ Creating bugs since 2017  <br>🤖 I'm currently diving into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  <br>🎯 Goals: Build cool projects, contribute to open source, and survive exams  <br>🎲 Fun fact: I sometimes debug better after a coffee... or a nap. I'm also currently trying to publish a game I made in Unity for Android.</p>
